# Custom-select-menu
Custom select menu built on native js.

# Problem:

There is no way to customize select with css. You can't set it's background or font.

# Solution

I created my own analogue of select tag with js.


# Main logic

There are two main tags: <b>option-selected and option-items </b> 

There are both generated by js. Data is used from old select tag.

When you click on option-selected 

* Enables class active which displays / hides all items

When you click on option-item's elements 

* Enables class active which set / reset darker background to indicate choosen element.
* Changes the value of option-selected
